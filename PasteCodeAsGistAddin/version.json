  "description": "This addin allows you to take selected code in the editor, or code pasted from the clipboard and publish it as a Github Gist.\r\n\r\nThe Gist is then embedded as a script link into the active editor window. Gists can be posted anonymously or under your user account when you provide a Github access token.\r\n\r\n*** Important: In order to use this plug in and get the <script> link to render, you have to set the `EditorAllowRenderScriptTags: true` in the Markdown Monster settings. Without this setting the script tag won't render as script and Gists are not properly embedded.",
