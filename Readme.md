<img src="PasteCodeAsGistAddin\Build\icon.png" width="128" />

This project provides a [Markdown Monster](https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com) Add-in for pasting code into a Markdown document based on a Gist that you create and post to Github, and then embed a link to - via `<script>` tag into the Markdown document.

Images are previewed and can then be pushed to Azure Storage with the resulting URL automatically getting embedded into the current Markdown document.

> #### Early pre-release
> This version is a pre-release version so installation and configuration is manual for now. Please see instructions below.
